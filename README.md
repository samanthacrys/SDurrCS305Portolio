* “Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?”

Artemis Financial is a company that helps people create financial plans. In the current form, they wanted to be able to create their customized plans with more modern software that allowed for the use of a web application to do so. They wanted me to address security threats that can come from the outside and could compromise the data of their customers.

* “What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?”
 
I would have to say that what I did well was analysis of the vulnerabilities. Since I tried to look at every layer, using elements, like the dependency check, allowed me to more easily delve into these different vulnerabilities and point them out. The biggest one being that SnakeYML seemed to have a vulnerabilities that made using it a concern. This presented a vulnerability in the code that wasn’t as easily mitigated by just coding securely. The reason this is important is that secure code helps to close holes that outside attackers can exploit. This adds to the trust that a company can rely upon to grow their customer base and keep their current customers happy.

* “What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?”

I will be the first to admit that this is a bit more difficult for me to answer. The reason being that I have had previous training in networking and systems security. I would have to say the most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment, based on my previous knowledge, would be more the programming side of things. Since most of my training came from pre-built areas, networking technologies and systems, what programming I did have was minimal and it wasn’t in the range of keeping the code up to date. So, I would say that was both challenging and helpful because it gave me another way to take in and look at the situation.

* “How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?”

I would say that I increased layers of security by looking at each individual layer and how it applies to a situation. Just because a situation looks like it may not use encapsulation, it is important to look at it. I made sure that each layer was protected. Since I also have the physical layers known as well, I can take what I know there and increase the layers of security by applying that in as well. In the future, I would add in dependency checks, which I will admit I hadn’t known about before this class. Adding those in allows me to more directly assess and mitigate through the use of these checks to understand the vulnerabilities and what fixes there are.

* “How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?”

I employed a hash algorithm to make sure that the code both ran and did the function that was required, but that it could secure the data. Of course, this refactored the code and that meant I needed to run a dependency check. This was important to do both before I added the hash algorithm and after I did so. This was to ensure that I knew what vulnerabilities were present to begin with and to make sure that I didn’t add any new ones. This also allowed me to be aware of any holes I potentially closed.

* “What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?”

Honestly, the best tool that I found was running a dependency check. This led to the NIST database website as a great resource for checking on current vulnerabilities or whether an API that was being used should not be. This is helpful in both the future for assignments and tasks because that means the code is being secured at all points instead of just in one class and I’m including it in the entire development process.

* “Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employee from this assignment?”

In the case of this assignment, I would be likely to show them project 1 or the module 2 assignment where we ran the dependency check. These two sections are mainly because it allows me to show where I looked in depth at the requirements, what could show the vulnerabilities and where I even found alternatives that, currently, show to be more secure. Since my main goal is to be a tech writer, this is an important tool and ability for one to employ.
